          <h3>“The Great Explainer” addressed what he found to be the key differences between mathematics and physics. His thoughts are summarized below.</h3>
          
          <ul>
            <li><strong>Mathematicians </strong>are only dealing with the structure of the reasoning and they do not really care about what they're talking about. They don't even need to know what they're talking about, as they themselves say, or whether what they say is true.</li>
            <li>Now, I explained that if you state the axioms to say "such and such is so" and "such and such is so", what then? Then the logic can be carried out without knowing what the "such and such" words mean.
       </li>
            <li><strong>The physicist</strong> has meaning to all the phrases and there's a very important thing that a lot of people who study physics, but don't come from mathematics don't appreciate: That physics is not mathematics and mathematics is not physics. One helps the other.
      But, you have to have some understanding of the connection of the words with the real world.</li>
            <li>If you say "I have a three-dimensional space" [...] and you ask mathematicians about theorems then they say "now look, if you had a space of n dimensions" then here are the theorems". "Yeah, well I only want the case of three dimensions..." "Well, then substitute n = 3!". It turns out that very many of the complicated theorems they have are much simpler because they happen to be special cases.
      
      </li>
            <li>When you know what it is you're talking about, that these things are forces, these are masses, this is inertia and so on, then you can use an awful lot of common-sense, seat-of-the-pants feeling about the world. You've seen various things, you know more or less how the phenomenon is going to behave.
      Well, the poor mathematician he translates it into equations and the symbols don't mean anything to him and he has no guide but precise mathematical rigor and care in the argument. 
      Whereas, the physicist who knows more or less how the answer can go, is going to come out and sort of guess partway and go right along rather rapidly.
      </li>
        
          </ul>
